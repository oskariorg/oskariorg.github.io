## News from the members

Timo Sallinen:
- Suomi.fi-maps has new users: municipalities and Tax Administration in Finland, 
this is something that could be interesting to other users

Sami:
- Jetty setup: Java class conflicts from Spring and XML-library dependencies have been resolved
- Gitter has been active, which is really nice! E.g. University of Lappeenranta was wondering how to include the analysis tool to an application now that they have been moved to oskari-frontend-contrib repository and are no longer part of the sample app.
- Map layer admin with React and 3D issues hopefully coming up during fall 2019. 
- 3D in published map is done already for Paikkatietoikkuna and on it's way to be moved to Oskari. Handling "unsupported" map functions are handled using the same workflow as in Arctic SDI with multiple projections. Now we can utilize these features for example when user clicks edit on a 3D published map while in 2D view. 

Jussi:
- Nothing has happened during summer

Sanna:

- Community page migration under way
- UI development/”New Oskari” planning in calendar this week with NLS-FI & Sitowise
- Workshop in FOSS4G Bukarest (on Monday 26th): “Oskari made easy”, planned together with NLS-FI & co
- Codento Ltd is a new organisational member (now 40 organisations registered in Oskari community)
